# Advocate Workshop Practices
The following is a list of elements present across a variety of Advocate workshops.
- Workshop Content hosted in repo where pull requests can be made by attendees to suggest updates to content. Attendees are able to fork the workshop.
- Workshops are commonly designed so that they can be displayed in a more traditional left side index format either through GitHub pages, docosaurus, docsify, or GitHub CodeSpaces. This is more likely with workshops that are often run.
- Workshop content is often step by step procedures interspersed with theory.
- Workshops average 75% hands on content and 25% theory (with variances between 60-90% hands on content and 10-40% theory depending on the level and nature of the workshop). 
- Workshops generally run for 60-120 minutes. Some workshops are actually workshop collections and are designed to run as courses across weeks and may include up to 10 individual workshops in a course (sort of like a workshop learning path ).
- Workshops include a prerequisite environment section on how to set up an attendeeâ€™s computer or a cloud environment (including GitHub CodeSpaces) on which the workshop can be run.
- Workshops often include slides associated with the content to be used by instructor.
- Workshops often include Train the Trainer materials often in the form of an unlisted YouTube video where the author talks through the content of the workshop and things the instructor should be aware of before teaching it.
- Workshops often provide quizzes at the end of workshops as a form of testing/validating knowledge based on workshop content.
- Workshops often include a license (MIT/CC etc) that allow reuse by the community.
- Workshops often include the ability to provide centralized feedback through a form.
- Workshops often contain links to supporting content on learn.microsoft.com.
- Some workshops include Clarity for tracking of attendee usage (often when built using Docusaurus)
- Workshops contain embedded videos with technical overviews, business case, and lab walk-throughs
